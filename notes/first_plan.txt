build emotion / affective model on MPIIEmo dataset
first use facial, bodily features, neural model, then SVM
need open face, open pose
need to put in a lot of work extracting features, writing to disk

next step: cross corpus... is there another emotion one??? integration of speech features?

applying such a model to another dataset?

then: social signal processing stuff?

questions to ask:
another emotion corpus?
openface, open pose?
How should we deal with outliers?
should we request PAVIS or can we have it directly?
Can we get the MPIIGroupInteraction dataset?
IDIAP Wolf, ELEA, HUMAINE and PAVIS all require EULA. Should we try and get them?
What do you think the major challenges will be wrt the data?
