Reminder

Direction: predicting emotions using gesture / facial / speech features
  face features: baseline = action units
                 higher level: mutual gaze?

baseline input: sequence of features corresponding to frames, ie we wanna model sequentially
baseline output: discrete emotion categories for each actor in each frame

Things we've done so far:
  - Rudimentary data analysis
  - generated emotion labels following the original

GESTURE FEATURES
  - tried to install openpose on server
  - did it on colab instead
  - began generating features for videos
  - generating images of openpose output every 10 frames so that we can manually verify quality of output
  - began normalizing output
  - write algorithm to associate skeletons to correct person in sequence of frames using minimum distance
  - wrote algorithm to associate skeleton sequences to actor label based on greatest displacement in first 10 frames
  - centre skeletons using mid hip as 0
  - scaled skeletons by vector norm of vector between mid hip and neck
  - working on interpolating missing keypoints

FACE FEATURES
  - Gained familiarity with OpenFace
  - Extracted features from the dataset
  - Preliminary statistics on the OpenFace output

NEXT STEPS (before next presentation):
  - complete raw feature extraction
  - complete normalization and verification
  - tidy/refactor preprocessing code
  - research, choose, implement two baselines on subset of data




The main thing, make sure to have a concise direction for your project. We want to make sure everyone is on the right track == describe the problem you want to solve ("we want the model to ____”), what is the input and what do you want to predict == how can you assess the model and its quality (“The model output will be: ____”, and “It can be defined as: ____”), how can you obtain the data needed, what type of methods will you deploy in order to model your problem setting? Think about the following:

1. Clear Problem Description: Do you understand the purpose of the model?

2: Measure its performance: How can you show the performance of the model (if it works well or not)?
